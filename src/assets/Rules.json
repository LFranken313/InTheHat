  "round3Content": "If you paid close attention in the previous rounds, you will excel here. You get one word only! Make it count.",
  "challengeTitle": "Want a challenge?",
  "challengeContent": "Try these twists:\nRound 1: No capital-letter words (bye-bye 'I', names, countries).\n\nRound 2: No pointing! Be the thing, not its use. Got 'Lamp'? You're glowing now.\n\nRound 3: One sound only. If you say 'uhm'. That’s it. Good luck, team!"
